# HexSpace

A simple test Unity 3D game.

Play it here: http://jussik.github.io/HexSpace/

* You are a ship with a laser in a hex-world with hidden enemies
* WASD to move around, click to shoot at cells to destroy them
* Your ship has a level and hit points (bottom left of screen)
* White numbers show the sum of adjacent enemy levels
* You can safely remove any cells where their level is equal or lower to yours
* Hitting a cell that is higher level than yours damages you
* Red numbers show the level of a previously destroyed enemy
* Destroy all enemy cells to beat the level
* Inspired by [Mamono Minesweeper](http://www.hojamaka.com/game/mamono_sweeper/en.html)
